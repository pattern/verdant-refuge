    Turn habits into rituals, so that you are drawn towards them.
    Disengage before bed to wind down.  Adjust as fit.  Allow
    imperfection.

-   [iPad + Linode, 1 Year Later](http://yieldthought.com/post/31857050698/ipad-linode-1-year-later)

    Mark O'Conner (MÃ¼nchen-based) on using an iPad and wireless
    keyboard as his primary computer device for a year (with a Linode
    server to do all the heavy lifting). Benefits are: keyboard stays
    cool, screen and keyboard can be separated for comfort, and can
    throw iPad into river and be up and running the same day. In
    theory the setup is device-agnostic, so the iPad can be swapped
    for anything else that fits the bill.
