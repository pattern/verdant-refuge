-   [The Oxford Comma and the Internet](http://blog.anguscroll.com/oxford-comma)

    Uses the oxford comma (i.e. "first, second, and third") as an
    example of about how the Internet is an echo-chamber, and about the
    disparity between how easy it is to write/tweet/criticize something
    as opposed to actually reading/thinking/comprehending.
