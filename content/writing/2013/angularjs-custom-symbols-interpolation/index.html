## The Problem

My first exposure to [Angular][angular] was in a [Django][django] environment. I was trying to format search results, and Angular seemed like a good way to structure and display the resulting data. I was soon confronted with the fact that both Angular and Django use the same `{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}` delimiters. Thus any Angular templating logic would throw Django syntax errors before as soon as it was interpreted.

## The Solution

Enter Angular's somewhat-well-hidden (from most of my attempted Google queries) [$interpolateProvider][angular-interpolate-provider] service. Quite simply:

    :::js+cheetah
    angular.module('app', []).
      config(function ($interpolateProvider) {
        $interpolateProvider.startSymbol('<[');
        $interpolateProvider.endSymbol(']>');
      });

As should be obvious, the symbols are now `<[` and `]>`, and Django will treat them just like any other markup, passing them right through for Angular to do its thing. There is nothing special about this particular choice, I personally wanted something without any curly braces so that they were visually distinct to avoid any possible confusion.

## Irony? Triple Threat? Inception?

Amusingly, [Jinja2][jinja2] -- the templating language I use in conjunction with [Hyde][hyde] for this blog -- also uses the beloved `{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}` to delimit print statements. As such, I must use the following to generate them:

    :::jinja
    {% raw %}{{% endraw %}% raw %{% raw %}}{% endraw %}{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}{% raw %}{{% endraw %}% endraw %{% raw %}}{% endraw %} and {% raw %}{{% endraw %}% raw %{% raw %}}{% endraw %}{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}{% raw %}{{% endraw %}% endraw %{% raw %}}{% endraw %}

Trust me when I say you do not want to see the necessary Markdown to get the above to display properly!  Fine, if you have a thing for necessary verbosity, [have at it][circular-reference].
