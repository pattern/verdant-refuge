**Update:**  One thing I know for sure is that long filenames is very unweildy...I think i may want to come up with 3-4 word names for the html files themselves, and maybe include a little more metadata in each article file.
{: .blurb }

## Motivation

-4 people, so QoS
  -Classification allows for better idea of what traffic is being handled
-Real-time bandwidth analysis, by IP address
-Monitor monthly bandwidth usage to be aware of how close to cap
-
-General nerdery (who doens't want to brag about overclocking their ROUTER?)

## Research

-The whole quest was spurred on by a post by Jeff Atwood of Coding Horror about [combining commodity hardware with open-source firmware][jeff-atwood-1].

## Hardware

A ~5 year old Linksys [WRT54GL][] (200MHz Broadcom CPU, 16MB RAM, 4MB Flash) willingly gave itself to the cause of being a Tomato guinea pig.
