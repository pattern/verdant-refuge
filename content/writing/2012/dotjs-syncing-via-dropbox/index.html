## The Problem --- Poor Usability

Many webpages have well thought-out designs with proper typographic sizes, line spacing, color choices, and a usable layout. There are still quite a few, however, which struggle with these considerations. Some use minuscule font sizes for body copy, some set line height equal to font size, and some have too little or too much contrast between text and background among other issues.

## The Solution --- dotjs

The **@defunkt**/[dotjs][dotjs] Chrome extension provides a framework with which to solve these problems. It allows you to write a JavaScript file for each domain (named `{domain}.js`) which will be loaded (along with jQuery) whenever you view a page on that domain.

did:  mklink /J "C:\Users\Jeff\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\longstringofletters\1.5_0\scripts" C:\Users\Jeff\Dropbox\dotjs
