## Discovery

Getting into the swing of HTML5 semantic markup again, I was looking for a way to semantically mark up figures in my writing on this site.  I wanted them to look good when viewed by a normal browser, but to also have semantic metadata such that the content will be easy to display in other formats (be it screen readers, RSS feeds, or something else entirely).

## The `<figure>` Element

Let us begin with the definition of the element from the [W3C working draft of HTML][w3c-figure]:

[w3c-figure]: http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/figure.html "World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Working Draft of HTML markup, figure element"

> "The figure element represents a unit of content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained, that is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document, and that can be moved away from the main flow of the document without affecting the documentâ€™s meaning."

> _--W3C HTML Markup Draft_
