# About

I'm Jeff Pickelman, hailing from the small town of Alamo, California. This site gives me a place to document and share my explorations in web development primarily, but also to catalog the various failed/in-progress/partially-functioning hardware projects I am tinkering with!

I can be reached via email at: my last name at gmail dot com.  I'm also on [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pickelman), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pickelman).
