# About

I'm Jeff Pickelman, hailing from the small town of Alamo, California. This site gives me a place to document and share my explorations in web development primarily, but also to catalog the various failed/in-progress/partially-functioning [hardware projects](/projects/#hardware) I am tinkering with!

I'm interested in web programming, python/Django, JavaScript, user interfaces, server hardware, storage, ZFS, audio amplifiers, diy electronics, Magic the Gathering, hiking, gardening and miniature painting.

I can be reached via email at: my last name at gmail dot com.  I'm also on [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pickelman), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pickelman).
