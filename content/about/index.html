# About

I'm Jeff Pickelman, hailing from the small town of Alamo, California. This site gives me a place to document and share my explorations in web development primarily, but also to catalog the various failed/in-progress/partially-functioning [hardware projects](/projects/#hardware) I am tinkering with!

I can be reached via email at: my last name at gmail dot com.  I'm also on:
{% import "macros.j2" as macros with context %}
{{ macros.render_social_list() }}

I'm interested in web programming, python/Django, JavaScript, user interfaces, server hardware, storage, ZFS, audio amplifiers, diy electronics, Magic the Gathering, hiking, gardening, painting, and grilling.
